![github-banner-image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b727c0f3-9df1-437d-ba43-ab4fe932ccc7) 👋

I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer passionate about building intuitive, impactful applications. With a background in Healthcare IT and hands-on experience in JavaScript, React, and the MERN stack, I thrive on creating tools that improve everyday experiences and inspire meaningful conversations.

🔭 I’m currently working on Verity — a social media platform focused on fostering real discussion and sharing accurate, verified information. I’m also developing a polished, responsive personal portfolio to showcase my work and journey, while actively exploring opportunities in Full-Stack Development where I can continue to grow and contribute.

🌱 Continuously expanding my understanding of UI/UX best practices to design more intuitive, user-centered applications.

👯 Open to collaborating on passion-driven projects that bring people together through thoughtful design and purposeful code.

💬 Ask me what it’s really like to build your first full app—from the mindset needed to push through roadblocks to the lessons you only learn by doing. No sugarcoating.
